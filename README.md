# Exploring-Pizza-Sales-Revenue-Trends-Ordering-Patterns-and-Visual-Insights-with-SQL-and-Power-BI



In this project, I analyzed a dataset of 48,620 pizza sales records to uncover actionable insights on revenue, customer ordering habits, and popular pizza categories. From identifying peak order times to assessing revenue by pizza category, these insights can help drive strategic decisions in the food service industry.

üîç Project Highlights:
Leveraged SQL in MySQL to calculate key metrics like total revenue, average order value, and pizza sales volume.
Analyzed hourly and weekly sales patterns to pinpoint peak order times, enabling targeted marketing.
Conducted pizza category and size analysis to identify top-performing items based on revenue and order volume.
Created an interactive dashboard in Power BI for easy visualization of trends and insights.
Verified accuracy by cross-checking Power BI dashboard metrics with SQL query outputs.

üíº This project demonstrates how SQL and Power BI together can transform raw data into valuable business insights for optimizing sales strategies.
